<h1>DBClient overview</h1>

<h2>What is DBClient</h2>

<p>DBClient is a simple Database explorer tool based on jdbc technology.
Because it follows massively plugin architecture, it provides useful tools for developers and administrators making it easy to show, edit and manage relational databases. The main idea of DBClient is to normalized RDBMS access. Altough jdbc is a powerful API for accessing (quite) transparently databases, DBClient tries to make it even more transparent by normalizing the way to access, edit and even administrate shuch databases both for applications (as library) and for direct use (as Frontend). This normalization does not mean not to be able to do specific or native staff. It only tries to to do it the way one should do it in other RDBMS if applicable. Mainly this is done by grouping/pairing equivalent functionnalities. So by providing a super-set of rdbms functionnalities, DBClient provides programmatic and mainly visual means to handle the same way all supported Databases. Actually, DBClient is at its very first releases and normalization is imposed by DBClient API and implemented in specific database centric Plugins.

<h2>One extensible tool for all RDBMS</h2>

<p>
One lovely tool shoud be a tool that behaves the same in different circomstances. This is accomplished through a set of plugins implementing the DBClient API. Actually 33 plugins are available, each of them adds specific functionnalty to the application.<br>
